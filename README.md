# Scientific Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks focused on scientific programming and numerical computation.  
The exercises explore mathematical series, numerical approximations, and binary operations.

## ðŸ§® Contents

1. **Approximation of Ï€**  
   - Implementation of the Maclaurin series for `arctan(x)`.
   - Comparison of convergence speed for different formulas.

2. **Exponential Series**  
   - Evaluation of the series for `e^(-x)` and error analysis.

3. **Stirlingâ€™s Approximation**  
   - Calculation of factorial approximations and analysis of absolute and relative error.

4. **Quadratic Equation Solver**  
   - Implementation of numerical solutions for quadratic equations with improved accuracy.

5. **Binary to Integer Conversion (`myint`)**  
   - Custom implementation of a function that converts a 16-bit binary number into an integer,  
     compared against Pythonâ€™s built-in `int()` function.
