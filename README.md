# Scientific Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks focused on scientific programming and numerical computation.  
The exercises explore mathematical series, numerical approximations, and binary operations.

##  Contents

1. **Approximation of π**  
   - Implementation of the Maclaurin series for `arctan(x)`.
   - Comparison of convergence speed for different formulas.

2. **Exponential Series**  
   - Evaluation of the series for `e^(-x)` and error analysis.

3. **Stirling’s Approximation**  
   - Calculation of factorial approximations and analysis of absolute and relative error.

4. **Quadratic Equation Solver**  
   - Implementation of numerical solutions for quadratic equations with improved accuracy.

5. **Binary to Integer Conversion (`myint`)**  
   - Custom implementation of a function that converts a 16-bit binary number into an integer,  
     compared against Python’s built-in `int()` function.

$\pi$ Convergence Analysis //LAB_2

This exercise focuses on **efficiency and error** by comparing two $\pi$ approximation methods:

* **Convergence Plot:** A figure is generated to compare the approximate $\pi$ values obtained by two distinct methods (e.g., Maclaurin and Leibniz series) as a function of the number of performed iterations.
* **Analysis:** The project determines which method achieves **faster convergence** and which requires **fewer terms** to reach a desired accuracy.*

  Taylor Expansion and Truncation Error //LAB_3

Implementation and analysis of a function's **Taylor series expansion** to study truncation error.

* **Taylor Expansion:** A chosen function is expanded around a point $x_0$ up to an order $N$.
* **Visualization:** The Taylor expansions for various orders $N$ are plotted alongside the exact function (using NumPy) .
* **Error Analysis:** Discussion on the nature and magnitude of the **truncation error** introduced by limiting the number of terms.
